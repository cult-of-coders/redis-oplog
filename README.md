## Introducing BlueLibs

- [GitHub BlueLibs Monorepo](https://github.com/bluelibs/bluelibs)
- Following the same bold vision of Meteor, but with a modern twist. www.bluelibs.com
- Read more about our approach coming from Meteor: https://www.bluelibs.com/blog/2021/11/26/the-meteor-of-2022
- We've implemented [RedisOplog](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-x-bundle#live-data) in our framework as well, but it also works with in-memory and with customisable pubsub, not bound to redis.

## RedisOplog

A full re-implementation of the Meteor's MongoDB oplog tailing. This time, reactivity is controlled by the app, opening a new world
into building reactive applications, highly scalable chat apps, games, and added reactivity for non-persistent data.

Incrementally adoptable & works with your current Meteor project.

## Installation

```bash
meteor add cultofcoders:redis-oplog
meteor add disable-oplog
```

Configure it via Meteor settings:

```
// settings.json
{
    ...
    "redisOplog": {}
}

// default full configuration
{
  ...
  "redisOplog": {
    "redis": {
      "port": 6379, // Redis port
      "host": "127.0.0.1" // Redis host
    },
    "retryIntervalMs": 10000, // Retries in 10 seconds to reconnect to redis if the connection failed
    "mutationDefaults": {
        "optimistic": true, // Does not do a sync processing on the diffs. But it works by default with client-side mutations.
        "pushToRedis": true // Pushes to redis the changes by default
    },
    "debug": false, // Will show timestamp and activity of redis-oplog.
  }
}
```

To see what you can configure under `"redis": {}` take a look here:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis#options-object-properties

```bash
meteor run --settings settings.json
```

## Notes

RedisOplog is fully backwards compatible, so there won't be any change in how you use Meteor, unless you want to fine-tune your application for absolute performance.

To make sure it is compatible with other packages which extend the `Mongo.Collection` methods, make sure you go to `.meteor/packages`
and put `cultofcoders:redis-oplog` as the first option.

RedisOplog does not work with _insecure_ package, which is used for bootstrapping your app.

## Stats

If you are interested in viewing how many observers are registered or memory consumption:

```
meteor shell
import { RedisOplog } from 'meteor/cultofcoders:redis-oplog';

// works only server-side
RedisOplog.stats()
```

### The levels of scaling reactivity

1.  Just add RedisOplog, you will already see big performance improvements
2.  Fine-tune your reactivity by using custom namespaces and channels
3.  Implement your own custom reactivity by using Redis Vent

### Events for Meteor (+ Redis Oplog, Grapher and GraphQL/Apollo)

### [Optimistic UI](docs/optimistic_ui.md)

If you are using Optimistic UI (Latency Compensation) in your application, you should give this a read.

### [How It Works](docs/how_it_works.md)

Find out what RedisOplog does behind the scenes

### [Fine Tuning](docs/finetuning.md)

Find out how you can use the advantages of Redis Oplog to make your app very performant.

### [Redis Failover](docs/failover.md)

Find out how you can hook into redis events to customize, when it fails.

### [Redis Vent](docs/vent.md)

Find out how you can customize your reactivity and enable it across multiple languages/microservices with ease.

### [Outside Mutations](docs/outside_mutations.md)

If you have different workers/services that perform updates to mongo and they exist outside Meteor, you can still trigger
reactivity for the Meteor instances with a few lines of code.
